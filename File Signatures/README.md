File Signatures and Their Importance in Cybersecurity

What Are File Signatures?

A file signature (also known as a magic number) is a unique sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file that identifies its format. It is used by operating systems and forensic tools to determine the file type, regardless of its extension.

Why Are File Signatures Important?

Accurate File Identification: Helps recognize files even if their extensions have been altered.

Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics: Crucial in malware analysis and forensic investigations.

Preventing File-Based Attacks: Verifies file types before execution to avoid security risks.
