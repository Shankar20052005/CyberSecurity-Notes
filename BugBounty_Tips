# My Bug Bounty tips:
1. Go for multiple domains/features or role-based access with 20 reports in the last 90 days.
    High chance for finding valid vulnerabilities

2. If the program is less responsive, and the hunters are active on the program,
    Less chance of finding valid vulnerabilities
    So, first response/triage should be in between 1–2 days, Time to bounty should be between 5–10 days
