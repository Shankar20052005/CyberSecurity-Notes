# My Bug Bounty tips:
1. Go for multiple domains/features or role-based access with 20 reports in the last 90 days.
    High chance for finding valid vulnerabilities

2. If the program is less responsive, and the hunters are active on the program,
    Less chance of finding valid vulnerabilities
    So, first response/triage should be in between 1–2 days, Time to bounty should be between 5–10 days

*** SOME PROGRAMS ALSO PROVIDE PARTIAL BOUNTIES APART FROM FULL BOUNTIES ***
*** KEEP YOUR HOPES HIGH ***

3. If the program is paying a low bounty for high-severity issues then it may not worth the time you have spent on the program.
    The bounty should define the time spent on the program.

    Low — $150–$250
    Medium — $500–$750
    High — $1500-$2000
    Critical — $3000+


AFTER PROGRAM SELECTION, SPEND ATLEAST 7-10 DAYS ON THE PROGRAM DEPENDING ON THE FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION.
IF YOU DIDN'T FIND ANY, MOVE ONTO THE NEXT PROGRAM BUT,
KEEP CHECKING THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM EVERY WEEK (AS THE CODE CHANGES AND FEATURES ARE DEVELOPED DAILY).
