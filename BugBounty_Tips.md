# My Bug Bounty Tips

### 1. Go for multiple domains/features or role-based access with 20 reports in the last 90 days.  
   **High chance for finding valid vulnerabilities.**

### 2. If the program is less responsive, and the hunters are active on the program:  
   - **Less chance of finding valid vulnerabilities.**  
   - First response/triage should be **between 1â€“2 days**.  
   - **Time to bounty:** Should be **between 5â€“10 days**.

> ***SOME PROGRAMS ALSO PROVIDE PARTIAL BOUNTIES APART FROM FULL BOUNTIES.***  
> ***KEEP YOUR HOPES HIGH.***

### 3. If the program is paying a low bounty for high-severity issues, then it may not be worth the time you have spent on the program.  
   **The bounty should define the time spent on the program.**

   - **Low** â€” $150â€“$250  
   - **Medium** â€” $500â€“$750  
   - **High** â€” $1500â€“$2000  
   - **Critical** â€” $3000+  

### AFTER PROGRAM SELECTION:
- Spend **at least 7-10 days** on the program depending on the functionality and features of the application.
- If you **didn't find any**, **move on to the next program**, but...  
- **Keep checking the previous program every week** (as the code changes and features are developed daily).
